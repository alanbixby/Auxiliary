### About
A slightly updated fork of the Auxillary module as a favor to someone asking in the `noblox.js` Discord server; my changes are completely untested, and I have never even used this bot before; the source code is WET and fails to use ES6 syntax- it is a non-maintained library for a reason.

I highly recommend using a paid service such as Clan Labs, instead of trying to trove through this mess- albeit if you must, this'll at least give you a head start. As aforementioned **my changes are untested**, so expect some casing errors in variable references, or overzealous removals of `data` wrappers from the transition of old `axios` web requests to `noblox.js` requests.
